# Project Safety Rules

## File Protection Rules
1. **Never Delete Project Files**
   - Do not use commands that can delete or overwrite project files
   - This includes but is not limited to:
     - `git reset --hard`
     - `rm -rf`
     - `del /s /q`
     - Any command that could result in data loss

2. **Safe Git Operations**
   - Always create backups before major git operations
   - Use `git stash` instead of reset when possible
   - Prefer `git checkout` over `git reset` for moving between commits
   - Never force push (`git push -f`) without explicit approval

3. **File System Operations**
   - Always verify the current working directory before operations
   - Use relative paths instead of absolute paths
   - Double-check file paths before any operation
   - Create backups before making significant changes

4. **Error Prevention**
   - If a command might affect multiple files, always ask for confirmation
   - Provide clear explanations of what changes will be made
   - List affected files before executing destructive operations
   - Stop and ask for help if unsure about any operation

5. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Keep track of important commit hashes
   - Document backup locations
   - Know how to restore from backups
   - Have a rollback plan before making changes

## Emergency Procedures
If files are accidentally deleted:
1. Stop all operations immediately
2. Check git reflog for recent commits
3. Look for local backups
4. Contact the project owner
5. Do not attempt recovery without explicit instructions

## Best Practices
- Always work in a clean working directory
- Commit changes frequently
- Create branches for experimental changes
- Keep backups of important files
- Document all major operations
- Test changes in a safe environment first
